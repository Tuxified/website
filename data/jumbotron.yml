  Inko is a statically-typed, safe, object-oriented programming language for
  writing concurrent programs. By using lightweight isolated processes, data
  race conditions can not occur. The syntax is easy to learn and remember, and
  thanks to its error handling model you will never have to worry about
  unexpected runtime errors.
