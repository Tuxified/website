title: Safe and concurrent object-oriented programming, without the headaches.
body: |
  Inko is a statically-typed, safe, object-oriented programming language for
  writing concurrent programs. Thanks to the use of lightweight processes,
  concurrency is easily achieved and data races are impossible.

  The compiler forces you to handle errors where they may occur, ensuring you
  never run into unexpected runtime errors again.

  The syntax is easy to learn and consistent, instead of using many different
  keywords and symbols. If you have ever used a programming language that uses
  curly braces, you'll feel right at home.
