title: A general-purpose and easy to use programming language
body: |
  Inko features deterministic automatic memory management (without a garbage
  collector), a pleasant way of handling errors, excellent support for
  concurrency, a simple syntax, and much more.

  Inko is easy to learn and get started with, whether you are coming from
  Python, Go, Rust, or another language. Thanks to its support for a wide range
  of platforms (including Windows), getting it up and running is a breeze.
