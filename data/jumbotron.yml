title: A language for building concurrent software with confidence
body: |
  Inko makes it easy to build concurrent software, without having to worry about
  unpredictable performance, unexpected runtime errors, race conditions, and
  type errors.

  Inko features deterministic automatic memory management, move semantics,
  static typing, type-safe concurrency, efficient error handling, and more.

  Inko supports 64-bits Linux, macOS and Windows, and installing Inko is quick
  and easy.
