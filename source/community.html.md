A healthy community is important for any programming language, and Inko is no
exception. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and

For more information, see the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct).

## Services

The following services are provided:

* The official [sub-Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/inko/).
* A [Matrix community](https://matrix.to/#/+inko:matrix.org) for chatting with
  fellow members of the Inko community.

Everybody participating in the community is subject to the [code of
conduct](/code-of-conduct).

## Using Matrix

Using [Matrix](https://matrix.org) and [Element](https://element.io) can be a
little confusing. To make this easier, you can take the following steps to get
connected:

1. Open the [Inko channel](https://app.element.io/#/room/#inko-lang:matrix.org)
   using Element.
1. Click the link shown to join the discussion. This requires you to sign in to
   Element/Matrix first.

If you want to view the discussion, without joining, you can use
[view.matrix.org](https://view.matrix.org/room/!CENmKDnMngVwJJrTry:matrix.org/).
