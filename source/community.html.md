description: Learn more about how to participate in the Inko community.
---

A healthy community is very important for any programming language, and Inko is
no exception. However, Inko is also a very new language, and as such we are
still in the process of setting everything up to foster a healthy community.

The following services are currently provided:

* The official [sub-Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/inko/)
* A [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/inko-lang/Lobby)

We are also looking into the option of setting up a
[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) instance in the future. Unfortunately,
the costs of doing so are quite high, so it's unclear when this will happen.
Self hosting would be an option financially, but maintaining infrastructure
yourself is quite painful.

Everybody participating in the community is subject to the [code of
conduct](/code-of-conduct).
