There are many ways to contribute, such as (but not limited to):

* Submitting bug fixes.
* Using Inko, and reporting any bugs you run into.
* Telling others about Inko.
* Hosting meetups and giving presentations.
* Fixing typos on the website, documentation, and other resources.

Certain projects may have specific contributing guidelines. If this is the case,
they will be found in a file called "CONTRIBUTING.md" at the root of the
repository.

## Source Code

All source code of the Inko project is hosted on
[GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/inko-lang), spread across several different
repositories. Some of the more commonly used ones are:

* <https://gitlab.com/inko-lang/inko>: the repository containing the compiler,
  runtime, and virtual machine. Also used for reporting bugs, requesting
  features, and more.
* <https://gitlab.com/inko-lang/website>: the source code of this website,
  including the manual. Issues related to the website (e.g. typos) should be
  reported here.
* <https://gitlab.com/inko-lang/inko.vim>: Vim support for Inko.
